# cppStudy
A simple repository to help me test/learn c++

Objectives:
- learn from scratch c++
- test things in c++
- become a better programmer
- have fun in the process :)

I plan to more or less follow the book *Programing Principles and Practice Using c++ Second Edition by Bjarne Stroustrup* at this beginning.  
From my research I think it's the right book for the purposes.

## I am learning to!
- Are you learning programming or learning c++?  
- Are you following the book above perhaps?  
- Would you like to talk about these things ?  
- Lets's talk! Open an a [issue](https://github.com/henriqueschultz/cppStudy/issues) and talk! :)
